This page is a work in progress. It contains links to and descriptions of my main personal and school projects. I hope to update it soon with interesting code snippets and screenshots of my applications in action.

### [ThirstyCat Twitter Bot][thirsty-cat-github]
* [twitter.com/TheThirstyCat]
* Automated detector that senses when cat approaches water bowl, captures a picture, and tweets photo using Raspberry Pi, force-sensitive resistor, Python, and Tweepy
* Wrote technical “How-to” guide to document build process and instruct others how to recreate the project  
<br /> 

### [VirtualInterview Command Line App][virtual-interview-github]
* Interactive mock-interview command line application built with Java and OOP design principles
* Uses file I/O to read and print sample questions, times user’s response, and allows user to 	add/modify/delete questions  
<br />

### [Burrels Ford Tribute Page][burrells-ford]
My first forray into HTML & CSS. This is over all a pretty simple page, but I implemented a couple of fun features like a photo slideshow and an embedded Google Map using the Google Maps API and a bit of Javascript.  
<br />

### National Park Reservation System Command Line App
Note: This is a module capstone project for Tech Elevator - I'll be able to push the source code to my personal GitHub later.
* Queries PostgresSQL database to display and reserve available camps based on user’s search parameters
* Program functionality and JDBC database queries verified with Junit integration and unit tests  
<br />

### Vending Machine Command Line App
Note: This is a module capstone project for Tech Elevator - I'll be able to push the source code to my personal GitHub later.
* Object oriented design that responds to user input and reads/writes text files to log transactions
* Collaboratively designed and implemented with pair programming
