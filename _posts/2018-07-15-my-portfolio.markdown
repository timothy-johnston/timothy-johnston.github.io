This page is a work in progress. It contains links to and descriptions of my main personal and school projects. I hope to update it soon with interesting code snippets and screenshots of my applications in action.

1. [ThirstyCat Twitter Bot][thirsty-cat-github]



2. [VirtualInterview Command Line App][virtual-interview-github]

3. [Burrels Ford Tribute Page][burrells-ford]
* My first forray into HTML & CSS. This is over all a pretty simple page, but I implemented a couple of fun features like a photo slideshow and an embedded Google Map using the Google Maps API and a bit of Javascript.

4. Vending Machine Command Line App
Note: This is a module capstone project for Tech Elevator - I'll be able to push the source code to my personal GitHub later.

5. National Park Reservation System Command Line App
Note: This is a module capstone project for Tech Elevator - I'll be able to push the source code to my personal GitHub later.
