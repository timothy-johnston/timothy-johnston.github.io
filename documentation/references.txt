Flip Card How-To

        Note: For "on-click" effect, use "active" in place of "hover"

Additional Flip tutorials (straightforward - try these ones first)
https://www.webnots.com/bootstrap-4-flip-card-widget/
https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/faq/how-to-create-3d-flipping-effect-on-mouse-hover-using-css.php

	Use in tandem with this, how to simulate a hover event:
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11038638/simulate-hover-in-jquery

	So, instead of having to hover over something continously to keep it flipped, can click a button, on the click
	of that button can then simulate a hover over the element to flip, then when another button is clicked the 
	hover simulation ends so the element is flipped back to its normal position

Notes to add to accomplishments
        Something I learned / improved on
                Focus on one thing wholly
                        on this project, things came together once i decided to simplify and complete a whole section before moving on to the next
                        at work, thigns came together when i made a todo list and worked though it logically
                                ex: nexen resiliency jira

Blog Post Idea
        strategies for web design for people without an eye for design
                1.) use the inspector
                2.) look for inspiration everywhere. Me: sunset and cstricks color scheme
                3.) simplify
